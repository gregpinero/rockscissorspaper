# rockscissorspaper
This is a fun P5.js script to watch rocks, scissors, and papers battle it out

Try it here:

Randomly populates canvas with rocks, scissors and papers and randomly move them around.  Upon collision the loser type turns into the winner type.  Use ctrl+r to change to removal mode where loser is deleted instead.

(The last 4 sprites of a given type will enter "hero" mode and actively pursue their "prey" and escape their "predators" in an attempt to rebuild their team.)
